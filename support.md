### FAQ

**How do I close all tabs from a specific domain?**

Right-click a tile, and a context menu with list of options will appear. Click "Close all tabs from..." to trigger this action.

**What happened to the option to remove duplicates from a certain domain?**

Having an option to remove duplicates from a certain website, and all duplicates seemed confusing and cluttered the context menu. My assumption is nobody intends to have any duplicate tabs, so that is now the only option. Pulsing duplicate tiles can be disabled in Preferences.

**Where did the tile drag icon go?**

Tile dragging has been overhauled in V2, and you can now drag a tile by simply holding the left mouse button and moving the tile to the selected position. This can also be done from the table view.

**How do I apply actions to certain tabs?**

This can be done in the table format view. Hold CTRL to select rows, or hold shift to select a range of rows. Then press the delete key to close/remove items, or use the context menu for more options to apply to your selection.

**Session management is slow.**

A bug was causing favicon cache data to be saved with session data, and this has been resolved. To repair your session data, please export it, and re-import it.

**I am experiencing performance issues.**

Try disabling screenshots, animations, session synchronization, or undoing of tab actions in Preferences. Enabling automatic tab discarding can also help improve performance on lower-end PCs.

**The extension crashed.**

This is related to the screenshot capturing API. While fixes are being tested, it is recommended to disable screenshot capturing if this is happening to you.

**Favicons are not displaying.**

If this happens, restarting the extension should fix it.
